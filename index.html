      <h2>The Inner Net loop</h2>
      <p class="section-lead">
        Mind (reflection), Body (breath &amp; biometrics), and Soul (intention)
        flow into a private Vault. Elevated Lives makes that loop visible,
        encrypted, and usable – without handing your inner world to ad networks.
      </p>

      <div class="grid-3">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Mind – reflection</h3>
          <p>
            Aura Resonance check‑ins, journaling, and guided prompts capture how
            you think and feel over time – a living mirror of your inner story.

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Body – breath &amp; biometrics</h3>
          <p>
            Optional breathwork, movement, and biometric streams connect your
            nervous system to your narrative so growth isn’t just in your head.

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Soul – intention</h3>
          <p>
            Commitments, rituals, and moments of return become anchor points in

      <h2>SoulPrints &amp; the Evolution Engine</h2>
      <p class="section-lead">
        SoulPrints are non‑transferable records of who you became in a moment –
        not collectibles to flip. The Evolution Engine reads those records and
        turns them into next moves: quests, reflections, and rewards that keep
        you growing.

          <h3>SoulPrints on Polygon</h3>
          <p>
            Every major turning point can be minted as a SoulPrint NFT on
            Polygon – soulbound‑style, with story‑rich metadata stored via
            decentralized IPFS‑backed storage.

        <div class="card ghost">
          <h3>Evolution Engine</h3>
          <p>
            A rules engine that looks at your patterns – wins, slips,
            reflections – and surfaces the next right experiment. Less doom
            feed, more deliberate evolution.

        <div class="card ghost">
          <h3>E‑consciousness currency</h3>
          <p>
            MoM Coin rewards attention, honesty, and follow‑through. It is
            coinscience: e‑consciousness currency that tracks how often you
            return to yourself and uplift the collective Inner Net.

      <h2>From trust to proof</h2>
      <p class="section-lead">
        Platforms asked for blind trust and sold your attention. Elevated Lives
        gives you receipts instead. Proof of Attention and Proof of Connection
        turn your own focus into the pillar: when you show up with mind, body,
        and soul, the system records it as a SoulPrint and rewards it with
        coinscience.

      <div class="grid-3">

          <h3>Proof of Attention</h3>
          <p>
            Sessions, breaths, reflections, and Sigil Sessions generate PoA
            scores – a privacy‑respecting measure of how deeply you engaged,
            not how long you doomscrolled.

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Proof of Connection</h3>
          <p>
            When your growth helps others elevate – in circles, studios, or the
            DAO – those moments can mint additional SoulPrints and MoM Coin.

            Your Inner Net lives in a Vault with consent‑based sharing and
            optional on‑chain attestations. You decide what is private, what is
            public, and what is provable.
